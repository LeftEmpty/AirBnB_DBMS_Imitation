## Software used
Quick explanation about the different software approaches used for creating the files for phase 1.

- the er diagram i handed in is made using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), it's saved as an xml on the drive (and github).
- there is another one using [eraser](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/V003WHWMpFb7fwvWsx3e), this however is not exported very well and the relations are bad, hence this plan was abandoned and now irrelevant.
- [YouPDF](https://www.youpdf.com/) was used to merge the pdfs for the final submission.
