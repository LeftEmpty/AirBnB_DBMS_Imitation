Hello Tom,

Thank you for your submission. 

- Data dictionary is missing from your submission. 
 

In ERM:
- please rename the PK attributes in each table from just id to user_id and host_id etc in their own tables. 
- user review: who will be giving a review to the user ? 

Rest of your work is fine. 

Best Regards
Musharaf
